# Brazil Weather Data API

[Ler em Portugu√™s](./README_PT_BR.md)

## Introduction
The Brazil Weather Data project is a purely educational initiative aimed at transforming the data from Brazilian automatic weather stations into a lightweight API. This project serves as an excellent resource for learning and experimentation with API development, data handling, and modern software engineering practices.

This API is hosted in a free tier webservice on [Render](https://brazil-weather-data.onrender.com/). Due the resource avaliable, the data is ingested in a local machine and only upload to the repository.

You can access the documentation at [GitHub](https://gregomelo.github.io/brazil_weather_data/).

## Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to provide easy and structured access to meteorological data from Brazilian weather stations. The API offers three main endpoints:
- `stations_data`: Provides data about the weather stations, including geographical location and date of implementation.
- `weather_data`: Offers meteorological data collected from the stations.
- `query`: Allows users to simulate SQL queries for customized data retrieval.

## Data Source
The data is sourced from the Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET - [Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia](https://portal.inmet.gov.br/)), ensuring reliability and comprehensiveness.

## Refactoring and Technical Stack
This project is a refactored version of a [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gregoryoliveira/brazil-weather-change-part-i-data-collection) focused on collecting and analyzing Brazilian weather data. The technical stack for this project includes:
- pandas for data wrangling.
- FastAPI for building the API.
- DuckDB as the database management system.
- pytest for running tests.
- Pre-commit and Commitizen to ensure code quality and standardized commit messages.
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions.

## Database and Scalability
Initially, the database for this project was populated locally due to resource constraints. This approach ensured a solid foundation for our initial data analysis and API functionality. However, in a professional setting, the system is designed to be scalable and automated.

Ideally, the data collection pipeline would be set up to run automatically on a monthly basis. This would allow the database to be continuously updated with the latest weather data. Such a setup would not only provide real-time insights but also enrich the database over time, enhancing the depth and accuracy of our analyses.

This automated approach, combined with a more robust hosting solution, would make the project more dynamic and valuable for ongoing weather data analysis and research.

## Installation
### Pyenv and Poetry
To get started with the Brazil Weather Data API, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed on your system for dependency management.

2. Ensure you have the python version 3.11.11 avaiable in your system using the command `pyenv versions`. If 3.11.11 is not listed, use the command `pyenv install 3.11.11`.

3. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gregomelo/brazil_weather_data.git
   ```

4. Navigate to the cloned directory and install the dependencies using Poetry:
   ```bash
   cd brazil_weather_data
   pyenv local 3.11.11
   poetry env use 3.11.11
   poetry install --no-root
   poetry lock --no-update
   ```

### Docker
To get started with the Brazil Weather Data API, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have (Docker)[https://www.docker.com/] installed and free space (around 3GB),

2. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gregomelo/brazil_weather_data.git
   ```

3. Run the command `docker build -t bwd-container .`.

4. After completer, run the command `docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 8001:8001 bwd-container`.

5. To use the API, open the address http://localhost:8000/. To read the documentation, open the address: http://localhost:8001/.

## Usage
### Starting the webservice API:
1. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   poetry run task run
   ```
2. Open your favorite browser and navigate to [Brazil Weather Data API](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).

Note: if your are running other service on 8000 port, you need to edit the running port on `[tool.taskipy.tasks]` section at `pyproject.toml` file.

If you want to kill all other process on 8000 port, you can use the command:
   ```bash
   poetry run task killr
   ```

### Accessing local documentation:
1. Run the following commands:

```bash
poetry run task docs
```

2. Open your favorite browser and navigate to [Brazil Weather Data API Docs](http://127.0.0.1:8001).

Note: if your are running other service on 8001 port, you need to edit the running port on `[tool.taskipy.tasks]` section at `pyproject.toml` file.

If you want to kill all other process on 8001 port, you can use the command:
   ```bash
   poetry run task killd
   ```

### Running tests
Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   poetry run task test
   ```

### Running the data pipeline
Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   poetry run task pipeline -- list_years
   ```

For example, to run the pipeline only for 2023:
   ```bash
   poetry run task pipeline -- 2023
   ```

For more than one year, digit years with a simple-space between then:
   ```bash
   poetry run task pipeline -- 2023 2022 2021
   ```
